title: "New Years Resolutions 2012"
---

I've never been one to get involved in new year's resolutions, I have in the past had a couple, but I always find that I don't follow through with them.

Just quickly, here is how Wikipedia describes a new year's resolution:

>A New Year's resolution is a commitment that a person makes to one or more lasting personal goals, projects, or the reforming of a habit. This goal must be reached by the Next New Year. Keep in mind that this is a goal, not a wish and should be something that you as a person could strive for. *Src: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution)*

Judging by what the above says, it shouldn't be hard to make your new year's resolution happen. But for some reason, in the past i've never managed it. Maybe i'm setting the bar for those goals to high, and so they're unachievable, or maybe it was because I was too lazy. Probably the latter.

I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one in this boat. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who set these goals, but deep down have no intention of achieving them, or they just don't do them.

Why do we need a new year to set ourselves goals? Why not set ourselves goals at any time during the year. If you want to achieve something, a new year shouldn't be the reason for you doing so.

From now on I'm going to continuously set myself a achievable goals, projects or new habits so that I can make myself a better person, or to make life more enjoyable. And to make it more interesting for me, I should work towards completling a new goal each month.

This list of goals isn't something that has to be achieved in 2012, it's an ongoing list. When I complete a goal i'll add a new one so then i've always got something to be aiming for.

So, here are a few goals to start with:
(In no particular order)

1. Learn a new programming language (Probably Ruby).
2. Contribute to an OpenSource Project, and I mean properly contribute, not just a few lines of code.
3. Take part in a charity fundraising event.
4. Compete in a running event (10K or over).
5. Become a qualified pilot.
6. Up my weight to ~60kg and maintain it.

Why not set yourself some goals.
